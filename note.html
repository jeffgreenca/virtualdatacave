        <p>As a previous reader of my blog, you know I mostly wrote articles
           outlining technical solutions, both design and implementation,
           especially related to wrangling VMware's enterprise software.
        </p>
        <p>The bulk of implementation details in this body of work is 
           no longer relevant to current solution versions.
        </p>
        <p>Nothing is ever really gone from the Internet, so you can always
           use some tech savvy to find archived articles you "really" need.
        </p>
        <p>But I would encourage you to look to more current information for
           today's needs, rather than relying on several year old designs.
        </p>
        <p>I hope to one day revive my blog, with a different technical focus.
           It may be some time before I get around to that.

           In the meantime, it's been a pleasure serving
           the community through sharing ideas and techniques, and feel free
           to reach out (GitHub or whatnot) any time.
